# Machine-Learning
The repository contains projects involving techniques used in Machine-Learning including Reinforcement Learning Projects.

## mlp4.pdf
  - Detailed report submitted as part of submission for project during studies at 'University of Edinburgh'
  - Project to study the effect of 'Exponential Linear Units (ELUs)' compared to other activation functions such as ReLu, Leaky ReLu with implementation of Leaky ReLu coded on tensorflow for the project.
  - Studies factors like pooling, dropouts along with different parameterization to study the curve of effect of the factors on the accuracy of prediction as well as the behavior during training and validation
## RELU-Gloriot.py 
  - This file contains implemention of 'Glorot' initialization to keep the weights balanced at start otherwise small or large weights dominate the output of the layers.
